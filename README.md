# gaussianEliminationCalculator

Created a gui which performs Gaussian elimination on a 3x3 matrix. The GUI shows the solutions for x1, x2, and x3 as well as the matrix in upper triangular form. If there is no solution or matrix cannot be manipulated into upper triangular form, then the GUI will say so. Please let me know if you find any errors.
